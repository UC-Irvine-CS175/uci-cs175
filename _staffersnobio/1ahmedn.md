Hello, I'm Janine and I am excited to be teaching DSC 10 this quarter! I'm originally from New Jersey but I've been at UCSD for over ten years both as a graduate student in Math and as a faculty member in Computer Science and now Data Science.  I love this course because it teaches you how to pose and answer interesting questions in any domain, so it really opens doors and allows you to dive into topics you're passionate about.
